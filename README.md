It is a regression predictive modeling problem, meaning that we will be predicting a numeric value, All input variables are also numeric, In this case we will fit a linear regression algorithm and evaluate model
performance by training the model on the test dataset and making a prediction on the test data and evaluate the predictions using the mean absolute error(MAE).
